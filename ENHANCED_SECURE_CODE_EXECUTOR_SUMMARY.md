# Enhanced Secure Code Executor Implementation Summary

## ✅ Successfully Implemented

We have successfully enhanced the Secure Code Executor with the three requested improvements:

### 1. 🐳 Sandboxing
**"Enhance the Secure Code Executor by containerizing each code execution in a secure sandbox (e.g., Docker) with strict system-level isolation."**

**Implementation:**
- ✅ `DockerSandbox` class for complete Docker containerization
- ✅ System-level isolation with unprivileged user execution
- ✅ Network isolation with configurable access controls
- ✅ File system protection with read-only containers
- ✅ Automatic container cleanup after execution
- ✅ Security options: `--network=none`, `--read-only`, `--user=nobody`
- ✅ Fallback to native execution when Docker unavailable

**Key Features:**
- Complete system isolation prevents host compromise
- Configurable network and file system access
- Automatic resource cleanup and container management
- Security-first design with minimal privileges
- Production-ready containerization

### 2. 🌐 Multi-Language Support
**"Expand the Secure Code Executor to support additional programming languages such as JavaScript, Bash, and Ruby alongside Python."**

**Implementation:**
- ✅ Support for 9 programming languages: Python, JavaScript, Bash, Ruby, Go, Rust, Java, C++, C
- ✅ `LanguageConfig` system with language-specific configurations
- ✅ Docker images optimized for each language
- ✅ Native execution support for all languages
- ✅ Language-specific security restrictions and patterns
- ✅ Compilation support for compiled languages (Go, Rust, C/C++, Java)
- ✅ Package manager integration where applicable

**Key Features:**
- Comprehensive language ecosystem support
- Language-specific Docker images and configurations
- Security restrictions tailored per language
- Both interpreted and compiled language support
- Extensible architecture for adding new languages

### 3. ⚡ Resource Limits
**"Introduce execution constraints (CPU time, memory usage, execution timeout) to the Secure Code Executor to prevent abuse or crashes."**

**Implementation:**
- ✅ `ResourceLimits` dataclass with comprehensive constraint definitions
- ✅ Real-time resource monitoring with `psutil` integration
- ✅ Docker-based resource limits using container constraints
- ✅ Execution timeout enforcement with automatic termination
- ✅ Memory usage monitoring and limit enforcement
- ✅ CPU usage tracking and percentage limits
- ✅ Process count limits and subprocess monitoring
- ✅ Output size limits to prevent resource exhaustion

**Key Features:**
- Comprehensive resource constraint system
- Real-time monitoring and enforcement
- Configurable limits for different environments
- Automatic violation detection and response
- Performance metrics collection and reporting
