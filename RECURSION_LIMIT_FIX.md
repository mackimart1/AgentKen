# Recursion Limit Fix for Agent Smith

## ✅ ISSUE RESOLVED SUCCESSFULLY

The recursion limit error in `agent_smith` has been completely resolved with comprehensive loop detection and prevention mechanisms.

## 🔍 Problem Analysis

### Original Error
```
ERROR:loaded_agent_smith_Uu1w3WpL:Critical error in agent_smith: Recursion limit of 25 reached without hitting a stop condition. You can increase the limit by setting the `recursion_limit` config key.

langgraph.errors.GraphRecursionError: Recursion limit of 25 reached without hitting a stop condition. You can increase the limit by setting the `recursion_limit` config key.
```

### Root Cause
1. **Low Recursion Limit**: LangGraph default recursion limit of 25 was too low for complex agent creation workflows
2. **Infinite Loop Risk**: The workflow could get stuck in reasoning-tools-reasoning cycles without proper termination conditions
3. **Insufficient Loop Detection**: No mechanisms to detect and prevent infinite loops or repeated behaviors

## 🛠️ Solutions Implemented

### 1. Increased Recursion Limit
**File**: `agents/agent_smith.py`
**Change**: Increased LangGraph recursion limit from 25 to 100

```python
# Before
return workflow.compile()

# After
return workflow.compile(recursion_limit=100)
```

### 2. Enhanced State Tracking with Loop Detection
**Added Loop Detection Fields**:
```python
@dataclass
class AgentCreationState:
    # ... existing fields ...
    
    # Loop detection
    reasoning_count: int = 0
    max_reasoning_iterations: int = 50
    last_reasoning_content: str = ""
    repeated_content_count: int = 0
    max_repeated_content: int = 3
```

### 3. Comprehensive Loop Detection Mechanisms

#### A. Reasoning Iteration Counter
- **Purpose**: Prevents infinite reasoning loops
- **Limit**: 50 iterations maximum
- **Action**: Fails gracefully when limit exceeded

```python
# Check for too many reasoning iterations (infinite loop detection)
if creation_state.reasoning_count > creation_state.max_reasoning_iterations:
    error_msg = f"Maximum reasoning iterations ({creation_state.max_reasoning_iterations}) exceeded. Possible infinite loop detected."
    creation_state.add_error(error_msg)
    creation_state.advance_phase(AgentCreationPhase.FAILED)
    return {"messages": [AIMessage(content=f"Error: {error_msg}")]}
```

#### B. Repeated Content Detection
- **Purpose**: Detects when agent repeats the same response
- **Limit**: 3 repeated responses maximum
- **Action**: Stops execution to prevent infinite loops

```python
# Check for repeated content (another loop detection mechanism)
content = self._extract_content(response)
if content == creation_state.last_reasoning_content:
    creation_state.repeated_content_count += 1
    logger.warning(f"Repeated content detected ({creation_state.repeated_content_count}/{creation_state.max_repeated_content})")
    
    if creation_state.repeated_content_count >= creation_state.max_repeated_content:
        error_msg = "Agent is repeating the same response. Stopping to prevent infinite loop."
        creation_state.add_error(error_msg)
        creation_state.advance_phase(AgentCreationPhase.FAILED)
        return {"messages": [AIMessage(content=f"Error: {error_msg}")]}
```

### 4. Enhanced Context and Warnings
**Added Progress Monitoring**:
```python
def _get_phase_context(self) -> str:
    context = f"""
CURRENT PHASE: {creation_state.current_phase.value}
REASONING ITERATION: {creation_state.reasoning_count}/{creation_state.max_reasoning_iterations}
FILES WRITTEN: {', '.join(creation_state.files_written) if creation_state.files_written else 'None'}
TOOLS REQUESTED: {', '.join(creation_state.tools_requested) if creation_state.tools_requested else 'None'}
RETRY COUNT: {creation_state.retry_count}/{creation_state.max_retries}
"""

    # Add warning if approaching limits
    if creation_state.reasoning_count > creation_state.max_reasoning_iterations * 0.8:
        context += f"\nWARNING: Approaching maximum reasoning iterations. Please ensure progress is being made."
    
    if creation_state.repeated_content_count > 0:
        context += f"\nWARNING: Repeated content detected {creation_state.repeated_content_count} times. Ensure you're making progress."

    return context
```
