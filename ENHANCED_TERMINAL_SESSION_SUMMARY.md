# Create collaborative debugging session
session = terminal_session_create_enhanced(
    session_id="team_debug",
    session_type="collaborative",
    agent_id="lead_dev",
    agent_name="Lead Developer"
)

# Add team members
terminal_session_join(
    session_id="team_debug",
    agent_id="backend_dev",
    agent_name="Backend Developer",
    role="collaborator"
)

# Collaborative command execution
terminal_session_execute_enhanced(
    session_id="team_debug",
