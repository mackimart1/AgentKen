## Description


    A simple calculator tool for demonstration.
    
    This tool performs basic arithmetic operations on two numbers.
    
    Args:
        operation (str): The operation to perform (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
        a (float): The first number
        b (float): The second number
        
    Returns:
        Dict[str, Any]: Result dictionary with status, result, and message
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: When operation is not supported or division by zero
        
    Examples:
        >>> result = sample_calculator.invoke({"operation": "add", "a": 5, "b": 3})
        >>> print(result["result"])
        8.0
        
        >>> result = sample_calculator.invoke({"operation": "multiply", "a": 4, "b": 7})
        >>> print(result["result"])
        28.0
