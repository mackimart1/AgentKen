# Modular AI Agents Implementation

This document describes the implementation of three modular AI agents that have been integrated into the AgentKen system architecture: the Debugging Agent, Learning Agent, and Security Agent.

## Overview

The three modular agents provide autonomous capabilities for system maintenance, optimization, and security:

1. **Debugging Agent** - Autonomous failure detection, logging, and resolution
2. **Learning Agent** - Performance analysis and optimization recommendations  
3. **Security Agent** - Continuous security monitoring and threat detection

Each agent is implemented with clear APIs, lifecycle management, and integration points with the core task execution pipeline.

## Architecture

### Core Framework Integration

All three agents extend the `BaseAgent` class from `core/agent_framework.py` and integrate with the `MessageBus` system for communication. They follow the established patterns for:

- **Capability Definition** - Each agent defines specific capabilities with input/output schemas
- **Message Handling** - Agents subscribe to relevant message types and handle them asynchronously
- **Lifecycle Management** - Proper initialization, health monitoring, and graceful shutdown
- **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error handling and reporting

### Database Architecture

Each agent maintains its own SQLite database for persistence:

- `debugging_agent.db` - Failure events, resolution patterns, system metrics
- `learning_agent.db` - Performance data, recommendations, learning insights
- `security_agent.db` - Security events, vulnerabilities, access logs, policies

## Agent Implementations

2. Tasks are monitored by debugging agent
3. Performance data is collected by learning agent
4. System metrics are continuously analyzed
5. Optimization recommendations are automatically applied

## API Reference

### Debugging Agent API

```python
# Detect and analyze a failure
result = debugging_agent.execute_capability("failure_detection", {
    "error_message": "ImportError: No module named 'requests'",
    "stack_trace": "...",
    "context": {"agent_id": "web_researcher", "task_type": "web_request"}
})

# Perform system health check
health = debugging_agent.execute_capability("system_health_check", {})
```

### Learning Agent API

```python
# Analyze system performance
analysis = learning_agent.execute_capability("performance_analysis", {
    "time_range_days": 30,
    "analysis_type": "comprehensive"
})

# Get optimization recommendations
recommendations = learning_agent.execute_capability("optimization_recommendations", {
    "optimization_type": "all"
})

# Get tool recommendations
tools = learning_agent.execute_capability("tool_recommendations", {
    "analysis_scope": "system",
    "priority_threshold": 0.5
})
```

### Security Agent API

```python
# Monitor for threats
threats = security_agent.execute_capability("threat_monitoring", {
    "monitoring_scope": "system",
    "sensitivity_level": "high"
})

# Perform vulnerability assessment
vulnerabilities = security_agent.execute_capability("vulnerability_assessment", {
    "target_component": "system",
    "scan_type": "comprehensive"
})

# Perform security audit
audit = security_agent.execute_capability("security_audit", {
    "audit_scope": "system",
    "compliance_framework": "general"
})
```

## Configuration

### Agent Manifest Integration

The agents are registered in `agents_manifest.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "debugging_agent",
  "module_path": "agents/debugging_agent.py",
  "function_name": "debugging_agent",
  "description": "Autonomous debugging agent...",
  "capabilities": ["failure_detection", "failure_resolution", ...]
}
```

### Database Configuration

Each agent creates its own database with configurable paths:

```python
# Custom database paths
debugging_agent = DebuggingAgent(message_bus, db_path="custom_debug.db")
learning_agent = LearningAgent(message_bus, db_path="custom_learning.db")
security_agent = SecurityAgent(message_bus, db_path="custom_security.db")
```

## Deployment

### Basic Deployment

```python
from core.modular_agents_integration import create_integrated_system

# Create integrated system
orchestrator = create_integrated_system()

# Submit tasks with integrated monitoring
task_id = orchestrator.submit_task_with_monitoring(
    task_type="data_analysis",
    payload={"data": "sample_data"},
    priority=2
)

# Get system status
status = orchestrator.get_integrated_system_status()
```

### Advanced Configuration

```python
from core.agent_framework import MessageBus
from agents.debugging_agent import DebuggingAgent
from agents.learning_agent import LearningAgent
from agents.security_agent import SecurityAgent

# Create message bus
message_bus = MessageBus()

# Create agents with custom configuration
debugging_agent = DebuggingAgent(
    message_bus, 
    db_path="production_debug.db"
)

learning_agent = LearningAgent(
    message_bus,
    db_path="production_learning.db"
)

security_agent = SecurityAgent(
    message_bus,
    db_path="production_security.db"
)
```

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Health Monitoring

The integrated system provides comprehensive health monitoring:

```python
# Get detailed system status
status = orchestrator.get_integrated_system_status()

# Check individual agent health
for agent_name, agent_status in status['modular_agents'].items():
    print(f"{agent_name}: {agent_status['status']}")
```

### Performance Metrics

System metrics are automatically collected and analyzed:

- Response times
- Error rates
- Security events
- Performance scores
- Agent health status

### Log Management

Each agent maintains detailed logs:

- **Debugging Agent**: Failure events, resolution attempts, system metrics
- **Learning Agent**: Performance data, recommendations, learning insights
- **Security Agent**: Security events, access logs, threat detections

## Best Practices

### 1. Error Handling

Always wrap agent interactions in try-catch blocks:

```python
try:
    result = agent.execute_capability("capability_name", payload)
except Exception as e:
    logging.error(f"Agent capability failed: {e}")
    # Handle gracefully
```

### 2. Resource Management

Monitor database sizes and implement cleanup:

```python
# Agents automatically clean up old logs
# Debugging agent: keeps 30 days of logs
# Learning agent: keeps 90 days of performance data
# Security agent: keeps 90 days of security events
```

### 3. Security Considerations

- All inter-agent communications are logged by security agent
- Task submissions are validated for security threats
- Access control policies are enforced
- Regular security audits are performed

### 4. Performance Optimization

- Learning agent provides automatic optimization recommendations
- System metrics are continuously monitored
- Performance degradation triggers automatic analysis
- Bottlenecks are identified and reported

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Agent Not Responding**
   - Check agent health status
   - Review agent logs
   - Restart agent if necessary

2. **Database Connectivity Issues**
   - Verify database file permissions
   - Check disk space
   - Restart agent to reinitialize database

3. **High Memory Usage**
   - Check for stuck tasks
   - Review active task counts
   - Clear caches if necessary

4. **Security Alerts**
   - Review security event logs
   - Check for false positives
   - Update security policies if needed

### Debugging Commands

```python
# Check agent health
health = debugging_agent.execute_capability("system_health_check", {})

# Analyze recent performance
analysis = learning_agent.execute_capability("performance_analysis", {
    "time_range_days": 1
})

# Check security status
security_status = security_agent.execute_capability("threat_monitoring", {
    "monitoring_scope": "system"
})
```
