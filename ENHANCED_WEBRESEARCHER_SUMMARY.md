## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Enhanced Research
```python
from agents.web_researcher_enhanced import enhanced_web_researcher

result = enhanced_web_researcher(
    "Research climate change impacts with fact-checking"
)

# Enhanced result includes:
# - Comprehensive fact-checking results
# - Source credibility analysis
# - Multilingual content synthesis
# - Confidence metrics and quality scores
```

### Fact-Checking Workflow
```python
from tools.fact_checking import fact_check_claim, cross_verify_claims

# Verify claims against multiple sources
fact_check = fact_check_claim(
    claim="Vaccines are effective at preventing diseases",
    sources=["WHO data...", "CDC reports...", "Peer-reviewed studies..."]
)

# Cross-verify multiple claims
cross_verify = cross_verify_claims(
    claims=["Claim 1", "Claim 2"],
    source_urls=["https://who.int", "https://cdc.gov"]
)
```

### Source Prioritization
```python
from tools.source_prioritization import rank_sources_by_trust

# Rank sources by trust and relevance
ranking = rank_sources_by_trust(
    sources=[...],
    query="research topic",
    prioritize_recent=True
)

# Results prioritize academic > government > news > blogs > social
```

### Multilingual Research
```python
from tools.multilingual_research import multilingual_search_query

# Generate queries in multiple languages
ml_queries = multilingual_search_query(
    query="artificial intelligence research",
    target_languages=["en", "es", "fr", "de", "zh"]
