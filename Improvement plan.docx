Proposed Plan & Areas for Improvement:

Based on this, here's a potential plan focusing on the most critical areas first:

Improve Task Assignment Feedback:

Goal: Modify the agent execution flow so that Hermes receives structured information about the outcome of assigned tasks (e.g., success/failure status, structured results, final state).
How:
Define a standard return structure for agents (beyond just the last message). This might be a dictionary containing status, result, and potentially final_state.
Modify tools/assign_agent_to_task.py to capture and return this structured information.
Update agents/hermes.py (specifically its LangGraph logic) to interpret this structured feedback and make decisions accordingly (e.g., proceed with plan, handle failure, report results).
Investigate Self-Evolution (agent_smith & tool_maker):

Goal: Understand how new agents and tools are created, tested, and integrated.
How: Read and analyze agents/agent_smith.py and agents/tool_maker.py. Assess the robustness and reliability of this process.
Assess and Enhance Testing:

Goal: Determine the current test coverage and add necessary tests for core components and interactions.
How: Use list_files to see the contents of tests/, read key test files, and identify gaps. Propose and potentially implement new tests.
Refine Error Handling:

Goal: Make the system more resilient to failures in sub-agents or tools.
How: Improve how errors are propagated back to Hermes and enhance Hermes' ability to handle different error types (e.g., retry, delegate differently, inform user).
Code Quality and Documentation:

Goal: Improve overall code readability, maintainability, and documentation.
How: Review key files (config.py, utils.py, core agents/tools) for clarity, add comments/docstrings where needed.



Recommendation:

I recommend starting with 

Point 1: Improving Task Assignment Feedback. This seems fundamental to enabling effective agent collaboration and achieving complex goals. Addressing this will likely require changes in tools/assign_agent_to_task.py, agents/hermes.py, and potentially establishing a clearer standard for what agent functions should return.

What are your thoughts on this plan? Would you like to prioritize a different area, or shall we proceed with planning the changes for the task feedback mechanism? We can also dive into agent_smith.py or tool_maker.py first if you prefer to focus on the self-evolution aspect.


Okay, we've examined the entry point (agent_kernel.py), the orchestrator (agents/hermes.py), and the crucial tool for delegation (tools/assign_agent_to_task.py).

Here's a summary of findings and potential areas for improvement:

Core Architecture: The project uses LangGraph for orchestration (Hermes) and dynamically loads agents to perform tasks. Hermes interacts with the user and delegates work using the assign_agent_to_task tool.
Task Delegation & Feedback (Major Gap): The assign_agent_to_task tool currently executes a sub-agent but only returns the text content of the sub-agent's final message back to Hermes. This is a significant limitation:
Hermes doesn't know if the task succeeded or failed.
Hermes doesn't get any structured output, only the last chat message.
Hermes cannot easily determine if the sub-agent needs further input or has follow-up actions. This makes complex, multi-step planning and reliable orchestration very difficult.
Agent Interface: Agents are expected to be Python files in agents/ with a function matching the filename, taking a task string, and returning a MessagesState-like dictionary. This convention needs to be strictly maintained, especially by agent_smith.
Error Handling: Basic error handling exists in assign_agent_to_task, returning the error message as a string. Hermes' ability to intelligently handle these errors is likely limited.
Testing: The README mentions testing, and a tests/ directory exists, but the actual coverage and effectiveness are unknown. The README also notes this is an area for improvement.
Self-Evolution: The mechanism by which agent_smith creates agents and tool_maker creates tools is core to the project's goal but hasn't been examined yet.

Some Next Step Suggestions (if you want to push even further):

Autonomous Goal Refinement: Right now it sounds user-driven ("user gives a task, Agent K figures it out"). Eventually, you could allow agents to propose subgoals or self-initiate tasks to enhance capabilities.


Tool/Agent Versioning: As agents and tools are auto-created, you'll eventually need a way to track versions, deprecate old ones, and maybe even "merge" similar ones.


Autonomous Testing of New Agents/Tools: Sounds like you started this, but expanding on automatic unit/integration testing (maybe using a "test agent") before deploying new agents/tools would be huge.


Energy/Awareness Efficiency: Add "resource monitoring" ¡ª tracking memory/CPU usage per agent and optimizing workflows.


Knowledge Distillation: Over time, Agent K could summarize learnings from past projects into a Knowledge Base Agent for faster future problem-solving.


Fine-grained Memory Manager: A way for agents to "forget" irrelevant memories or prioritize important ones might become important as the memory database grows.


Security Layers: Especially if tools can execute shell commands/code ¡ª sandboxing, validation, and permission management will become critical.


Plugin System: Consider eventually letting users dynamically add new tool/agent plugins at runtime without a full redeploy.
