Based on the README and the file structure, here are some initial thoughts on potential areas to investigate for gaps and improvements:

Testing: The README explicitly mentions that more can be done regarding tests. We should check the existing tests in the tests/ directory to see the current coverage and identify missing tests for agents and tools.

Agent Implementation & Collaboration: How are the core agents (Hermes, AgentSmith, ToolMaker, WebResearcher) implemented? How do they interact and pass information? Is the collaboration logic robust?

Tool Functionality & Coverage: Are the tools in the tools/ directory sufficient? Are there common tasks that lack dedicated tools? Are the existing tools well-implemented and tested?

Self-Evolution Process: How does AgentSmith create new agents? How does ToolMaker create new tools? Is this process reliable and efficient? Can it handle complex requirements?

Error Handling & Resilience: How does the system handle errors if an agent fails or a tool malfunctions?

Configuration & Setup: Is the configuration (config.py, .env) clear and easy to manage? Is the Docker setup (Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml) optimal?

Code Quality & Documentation: Is the code well-structured, readable, and documented with comments or docstrings?
