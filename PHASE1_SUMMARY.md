cd <project-directory>
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup_permissioned_system.py
python validate_phase1.py
```

### 2. First Entity Creation
```bash
# Tool Maker role
python create_entity.py tool my_tool \
  --user=your_username \
  --role=tool_maker \
  --description="My first tool"

# Agent Smith role
python create_entity.py agent my_agent \
  --user=your_username \
  --role=agent_smith \
  --description="My first agent" \
  --tools="my_tool"
```

### 3. Development Workflow
```bash
# Make changes
# Run tests
python -m pytest

# Format code
black .
isort .

# Commit (triggers validation)
git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature"
```
