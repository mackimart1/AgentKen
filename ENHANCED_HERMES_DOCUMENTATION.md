# Enhanced Hermes Documentation

## Overview

Enhanced Hermes is an advanced version of the AgentK orchestrator with three key improvements:

1. **Context Awareness** - Cross-session memory and learning capabilities
2. **Dynamic Plan Adaptation** - Real-time plan modification based on execution feedback  
3. **Multi-Tasking** - Priority-based task scheduling with dynamic reprioritization

## Key Features

### ðŸ§  Context Awareness

Enhanced Hermes maintains context across sessions, learning from past interactions to provide more intelligent orchestration.

**Capabilities:**
- **Cross-Session Memory**: Remembers user preferences, successful patterns, and failed approaches
- **User Preference Learning**: Adapts to user working styles and agent preferences
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies successful workflows and reuses them
- **Performance Tracking**: Monitors agent performance for better future assignments

**Implementation:**
- `ContextManager` class handles context storage and retrieval
- Integration with memory manager for persistent storage
- Context-aware agent recommendations based on historical performance

### ðŸ”„ Dynamic Plan Adaptation

Plans can be modified in real-time based on execution feedback, reducing the need for user intervention when things go wrong.

**Capabilities:**
- **Failure Detection**: Automatically detects when plan steps fail
- **Adaptation Strategies**: Multiple strategies for plan modification
- **Real-Time Modification**: Plans adapt without stopping execution
- **Learning from Failures**: Adaptation history improves future planning

**Adaptation Strategies:**
- **Agent Substitution**: Replace unavailable agents with alternatives
- **Step Decomposition**: Break complex steps into smaller sub-tasks
- **Dependency Reordering**: Adjust execution order based on actual dependencies
- **Step Modification**: Modify approach based on error analysis
- **Parallel Execution**: Execute independent steps simultaneously
- **Fallback Strategy**: Use alternative approaches when primary fails

### ðŸ“‹ Multi-Tasking

Manage multiple simultaneous tasks with intelligent priority-based scheduling.

**Capabilities:**
- **Priority-Based Scheduling**: Tasks executed based on priority and dependencies
- **Dynamic Reprioritization**: Priorities adjust based on urgency and interdependencies
- **Dependency Management**: Automatic handling of task dependencies
- **Resource Allocation**: Intelligent assignment of agents to tasks
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time monitoring of task execution

**Priority Levels:**
- **CRITICAL**: Immediate execution required
- **HIGH**: Important tasks that should be prioritized
- **NORMAL**: Standard priority tasks
- **LOW**: Tasks that can be deferred

## Architecture

### Enhanced State Structure

```python
class EnhancedHermesState(TypedDict):
    # Standard Hermes state
    messages: Annotated[Sequence[BaseMessage], operator.add]
    plan_step_count: int
    initial_goal: Optional[str]
    
    # Context awareness
    session_id: str
    user_id: Optional[str]
    context: Dict[str, Any]
    
    # Multi-tasking
    active_tasks: Dict[str, Task]
    task_queue: List[str]
    current_task_id: Optional[str]
    
    # Plan adaptation
    current_plan: Optional[ExecutionPlan]

```

### Core Components

#### TaskScheduler
Manages task creation, prioritization, and execution order.

```python
scheduler = TaskScheduler()
scheduler.add_task(task)
next_task = scheduler.get_next_task()
scheduler.mark_completed(task_id, result)
```

#### PlanAdapter
Handles dynamic plan adaptation based on execution feedback.

```python
adapter = PlanAdapter()
analysis = adapter.analyze_execution_feedback(plan, failed_step, error)
adapted_plan = adapter.adapt_plan(plan, adaptation_strategy)
```

#### ContextManager
Manages context awareness and cross-session learning.

```python
context_mgr = ContextManager()
context = context_mgr.load_context(session_id, user_id)
context_mgr.save_context_snapshot(session_id, goal, completed_tasks, insights)
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Enhanced Session

```python
from agents.hermes_enhanced import enhanced_hermes

# Start enhanced session with context awareness
result = enhanced_hermes(
    uuid="session_123",
    user_id="user_456"  # Optional for cross-session context
)
```

### Context-Aware Workflow

```python
# Load previous context
context = load_context(session_id="session_123", user_id="user_456")

# Create tasks based on context
if context.get("preferred_agent") == "software_engineer":
    create_task(
        description="Code development task",
        assigned_agent="software_engineer",
        priority="HIGH"
    )

# Save insights for future sessions
save_context(
    session_id="session_123",
    context_type="insight",
    data={"successful_pattern": "step_by_step_development"},
    importance=8
)
```

### Multi-Task Management

```python
# Create multiple prioritized tasks
tasks = [
    {"description": "Fix security bug", "priority": "CRITICAL"},
    {"description": "Add new feature", "priority": "HIGH"},
    {"description": "Update docs", "priority": "LOW"}
]

for task_data in tasks:
    create_task(**task_data)

# Get next task based on priority
next_task = get_next_task()

# Execute and update
update_task(
    task_id=next_task["task"]["id"],
    status="completed",
    result="Task completed successfully"
)
```

### Plan Adaptation Workflow

```python
# Create adaptive plan
plan = create_adaptive_plan(
    goal="Complete project milestone",
    available_agents=["software_engineer", "web_researcher"]
)

# Simulate execution with failure
execution_feedback = [
    {"status": "success", "step_index": 0},
    {"status": "failure", "step_index": 1, "message": "Agent timeout"}
]

# Analyze and adapt
analysis = analyze_plan_execution(
    plan_text=plan["plan"]["original_plan"],
    execution_feedback=execution_feedback,
    goal=plan["plan"]["goal"]
)

if analysis["adaptation_recommendations"]:
    adapted_plan = adapt_plan(
        original_plan=plan["plan"]["original_plan"],
        failure_reason="Agent timeout",
        failed_step="Step 2",
        adaptation_strategy="agent_substitution"
    )
```
