# Enhanced Agent Smith Implementation Summary

## ✅ Successfully Implemented

We have successfully enhanced Agent Smith with the three requested improvements:

### 1. 🔧 Self-Healing
**"Implement self-monitoring capabilities for AgentSmith that allow it to detect crashes or anomalies and autonomously reload or roll back to a stable state."**

**Implementation:**
- ✅ `SelfHealingMonitor` class for continuous system monitoring
- ✅ Real-time health metrics collection (CPU, memory, disk, threads)
- ✅ Autonomous anomaly detection and recovery
- ✅ Multiple recovery strategies (memory cleanup, component restart, rollback)
- ✅ Self-healing tools: `check_system_health`, `perform_recovery_action`, `configure_monitoring`
- ✅ Emergency recovery procedures
- ✅ Health history tracking and recovery logging

**Key Features:**
- Continuous monitoring with configurable thresholds
- Automatic memory cleanup and garbage collection
- Component restart and module reload capabilities
- Emergency recovery with multiple action types
- Health scoring and status assessment
- Recovery attempt logging and success tracking

### 2. 📚 Agent Versioning
**"Introduce a version control mechanism in AgentSmith that tracks changes to agents and allows rollback to previous versions when issues arise."**

**Implementation:**
- ✅ `AgentVersionManager` class for complete version control
- ✅ Automatic version creation with metadata tracking
- ✅ SHA256 hash verification for file integrity
- ✅ Instant rollback to any previous version
- ✅ Version comparison and diff generation
- ✅ Versioning tools: `create_agent_version`, `rollback_agent_version`, `list_agent_versions`, `compare_agent_versions`
- ✅ Version registry with persistent storage

**Key Features:**
- Semantic versioning (v1.0, v1.1, etc.)
- Complete metadata tracking (author, description, timestamps)
- File integrity verification with hash checking
- Version comparison with content diff analysis
- Rollback with automatic backup creation
- Registry management with cleanup capabilities

### 3. 🧪 Testing Framework
**"Build an automated testing framework for AgentSmith to validate agent functionality and behavior before deployment, using unit and integration tests."**

**Implementation:**
- ✅ `AgentTestFramework` class for comprehensive testing
- ✅ Automatic test suite generation based on agent analysis
- ✅ Multiple test types: unit, integration, performance
- ✅ Code validation and compliance checking
- ✅ Testing tools: `generate_agent_tests`, `run_agent_tests`, `validate_agent_code`
- ✅ Quality scoring and grading system
- ✅ Test result tracking and summary reporting

**Key Features:**
- Automatic test generation from agent code analysis
- Comprehensive test types (unit, integration, performance)
- Code compliance validation with scoring
- Best practices recommendations
- Automated test execution with detailed results
- Quality grading system (A-F grades)

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Enhanced Agent Creation
```python
from agents.agent_smith_enhanced import agent_smith_enhanced

result = agent_smith_enhanced(
    "Create a data processing agent with comprehensive testing"
)

# Enhanced result includes:
# - Version information
# - Test results
# - Health status
# - Rollback capability
```

### Self-Healing Operations
```python
from tools.self_healing import check_system_health, perform_recovery_action

# Monitor health
health = check_system_health(component="system", detailed=True)

# Perform recovery if needed
recovery = perform_recovery_action(recovery_type="memory_cleanup")
```

### Version Management
```python
from tools.agent_versioning import create_agent_version, rollback_agent_version

# Create version before changes
version = create_agent_version(
    agent_name="my_agent",
    file_path="agents/my_agent.py",
    description="Pre-modification backup"
)

# Rollback if issues arise
rollback = rollback_agent_version(agent_name="my_agent", version="v1.0")
```

### Automated Testing
```python
from tools.agent_testing import generate_agent_tests, run_agent_tests

# Generate comprehensive tests
tests = generate_agent_tests(
    agent_name="my_agent",
    agent_file_path="agents/my_agent.py",
    test_types=["unit", "integration", "performance"]
)

# Run tests and get results
results = run_agent_tests(agent_name="my_agent")
```
